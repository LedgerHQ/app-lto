# Building

In order to build this application you need to create a Ledger development environment.  More information can be 
found here: https://ledger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userspace/getting_started.html

This process involves the setup of a toolchain, SDK, compiler, paths and many libraries. I have prepared a virtual machine with everithing ready to build this wallet application.
For that, just ping me on Telegram.
